# City of Manhattan, KS Housing Dashboard
The City of Manhattan, KS Housing Dashboard project aims to provide a comprehensive visualisation of the housing landscape in Manhattan, Kansas. Through maps, graphs, and analytics, the dashboard 
conveys current housing distribution, highlights areas of high demand, compares trends, and prioritises development zones. By aiding in informed decision-making, fostering public engagement, 
optimising resource allocation, enabling long-term planning, and serving as a potential model for broader initiatives, this project holds significant impact for urban development and community 
well-being beyond Manhattan.
